1.  Calculation of P Kernel have affect the outputs     (To Test)
2.  Calculation of HMax have affect the outputs         (To Test)
3.  Fast Fourier is available in SciPy with two different approaches: 1. Signal Processing 2. Image Processing  (To Test)
4.  Fourier Of Convolution is available in SciPy. Check if using the SciPy library for getting the fast foutier, is another approach to avoid making Wrapped around coefficients manually. (To Test)
5.  Decimal Accuracy have affect on calculations speed (Information)
6.  innerloop_convergance_upper_bound have affect on calculations speed (increase and decrease the iterations steps) (Information)
7.  below criteria and a similar one for the Pij_old has to be checked as a convergence criteria for outer loop!!!!!!!!!!!
    if(extensions.safe_float_comparison(a=self.parameters.Hij_old,b= self.preprocessor.Height_Matrix[i,j],decimal_accuracy=3)):
        continue #this means the Hij_old has no change.
    else:
        self.preprocessor.Height_Matrix[i,j] = self.parameters.Hij_old
8.  update_F_Kernel_IJexcluded() ---- It is important to send Fij as axi-symmetric or wrapped around (To Test -> Axi-Symmetric)
9.  update_Pold_Kernel ---- It can be considered with different values based on the point of view. (To Test)
        1. All Ps are the same and is as initial P 
        2. The Ps of the P matrix 
        3. Mixture of them
*10.The Laplacian of Roughness, it must be calculated before padding or after Padding! right now, it is before padding. (To Test -> Laplacian After padding is now considered)
11. Update rule for Height of near neighbor cells (Line 125 - self.parameters.update_height_kernel_3x3())
12. What does it mean if Aij is equal to ZERO!? -> It raises failure and provide wrong answers 
13. for P calculation using the nearNeighbors, we have different approaches:
        1.  Unified initial Pressure
        2.  Using the Current Ps from the P_Matrix for all steps
        3,  Using the Current Ps in cached Matrix for each step






++++!!! Why we only use one point of near neighbours contribution from the convolved data!?
***!!! To increase performance, which data acquisitions can be moved to the outer loop!!!? e.g. 3x3 and 5x5 matrices!!
